# Handwriting-Recognition

This project is center around implementing solutions to image recognition problems, which is the basic building block of many applications, ranging from photo apps like Google Lens or Face recognition to self-driving cars.
The specific problem that this project will focus on is handwriting recognition. More specifically, this program can read in images of hand-written digits and determine which digit the image shows.

## Algorithms
- Parallel K-Nearest-Neighbour (kNN)
  -  parallelizing the code to run over multiple processes which can be distributed over the the cores in the processor. 
- Decision Tree
